## Key points in the process
- This was a group project, and in so, we had a lot of experience working with Git and GitHub.
- Reading, understanding and debugging team member's code.
- We were given the JSON files that would become our database, and had to make to most of them.

### potential additions 
Starting this project we had (like many before us) many unrealistic goals. for now, these will be my future stretch goals.
 - Update user profile: image, name, preferred color, purchase history.
 - admin access that allows to change the products, and quantities.
 - "people that have bought this, also bought that" feature.
 - reviews.
